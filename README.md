## 1. Evolutionary Social Dynamics - Overview of the Code Functionality
🧬 Evolutionary Dynamics in Social Systems
This project provides a simulation framework for modeling and analyzing evolutionary game dynamics in large-scale, networked social systems. It integrates models for opinion dynamics, migration patterns, and the emergence of social conventions, using realistic social networks and continuous strategy spaces.

The framework is modular, extensible, and designed to support both theoretical explorations and data-driven validation of complex adaptive systems.

🔍 Key Features
📈 Opinion Dynamics
Simulate how individual opinions evolve in a social network under the pressures of conformity, mutation, and selection using replicator dynamics.

🌍 Migration Model
Capture movement patterns of populations across locations based on adaptive migration propensities and resource availability.

🤝 Social Convention Evolution
Model the emergence and stabilization of social norms through local coordination on networks.

🧠 Evolutionary Analysis & Stability
Evaluate system convergence, strategy variance, and identify stable strategies using kernel density estimation.

🔬 Synthetic Network Generator
Build realistic hybrid networks combining scale-free and small-world properties for agent-based simulations.
